Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s. Specifically:

Each letter in pattern maps to exactly one unique word in s.
Each unique word in s maps to exactly one letter in pattern.
No two letters map to the same word, and no two words map to the same letter.
 

Example 1:

Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"

Output: true

Explanation:

The bijection can be established as:

'a' maps to "dog".
'b' maps to "cat".
Example 2:

Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"

Output: false

Example 3:

Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"

Output: false
```
